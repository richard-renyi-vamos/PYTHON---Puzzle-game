Sure! Hereâ€™s a simple Python script for a puzzle game. This script creates a basic number puzzle game where the player must arrange numbers in order. The game is similar to the 15-puzzle but is simplified for easy understanding.

Puzzle Game Script: Sliding Puzzle
python
Copy code
import random

def create_puzzle(size):
    """Creates a size x size puzzle with numbers 1 to size^2 - 1."""
    puzzle = list(range(1, size*size)) + [0]
    random.shuffle(puzzle)
    return [puzzle[i*size:(i+1)*size] for i in range(size)]

def print_puzzle(puzzle):
    """Prints the puzzle in a readable format."""
    for row in puzzle:
        print(' '.join(str(n).rjust(2, ' ') for n in row))

def find_empty(puzzle):
    """Finds the position of the empty space (0)."""
    for i, row in enumerate(puzzle):
        if 0 in row:
            return i, row.index(0)

def is_solved(puzzle):
    """Checks if the puzzle is solved."""
    size = len(puzzle)
    correct = list(range(1, size*size)) + [0]
    return puzzle == [correct[i*size:(i+1)*size] for i in range(size)]

def move(puzzle, direction):
    """Moves the empty space (0) in the given direction if possible."""
    x, y = find_empty(puzzle)
    size = len(puzzle)
    if direction == 'up' and x > 0:
        puzzle[x][y], puzzle[x-1][y] = puzzle[x-1][y], puzzle[x][y]
    elif direction == 'down' and x < size-1:
        puzzle[x][y], puzzle[x+1][y] = puzzle[x+1][y], puzzle[x][y]
    elif direction == 'left' and y > 0:
        puzzle[x][y], puzzle[x][y-1] = puzzle[x][y-1], puzzle[x][y]
    elif direction == 'right' and y < size-1:
        puzzle[x][y], puzzle[x][y+1] = puzzle[x][y+1], puzzle[x][y]
    else:
        print("Invalid move!")

def main():
    size = 3  # 3x3 puzzle
    puzzle = create_puzzle(size)
    
    while not is_solved(puzzle):
        print_puzzle(puzzle)
        move_input = input("Move (up, down, left, right): ").lower()
        move(puzzle, move_input)
    
    print("Congratulations! You've solved the puzzle!")
    print_puzzle(puzzle)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
How to Play:
Create Puzzle: The game generates a 3x3 puzzle grid with numbers from 1 to 8, leaving one space empty (0).
Print Puzzle: The puzzle is printed in a format that shows all the numbers.
Find Empty Space: The position of the empty space is identified.
Player Moves: You can type 'up', 'down', 'left', or 'right' to slide the empty space and rearrange the numbers.
Win Condition: The game checks if the puzzle is solved (all numbers in order from 1 to 8 followed by 0).
Repeat: The game continues until you solve the puzzle.
Enjoy the game! ðŸ˜ŠðŸŽ®
